# Online-Bookstore-SQL-project

## ðŸ“š SQL Project: Online Bookstore

A hands-on SQL project designed around an Online Bookstore dataset. The project uses three interconnected tables (Books, Customers, Orders) to solve a variety of queries ranging from simple data retrieval to complex aggregations.

## âœ¨ What this Project Covers

The project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract meaningful insights from relational data. Queries span across:

## ðŸ”¹ Basic Queries

Retrieve all books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction).

Find books published after 1950.

List customers from Canada.

Show orders placed in November 2023.

Retrieve total stock of books available.

Find the most expensive book.

Show customers who ordered more than one quantity.

Retrieve orders where total amount exceeds $20.

List all available genres.

Find the book with the lowest stock.

Calculate total revenue generated.

## ðŸ”¹ Advanced Queries

Total books sold by each genre.

Average price of books in the Fantasy genre.

Customers who placed at least 2 orders.

Most frequently ordered book.

Top 3 most expensive books in Fantasy genre.

Total quantity sold by each author.

Cities of customers who spent over $30.

Customer who spent the most overall.

Remaining stock after fulfilling all orders.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

PostgreSQL  â€“ core query language for analysis.

CSV Files â€“ Books.csv, Customers.csv, Orders.csv used as input datasets.

Relational Schema â€“ Customer_ID and Book_ID act as common keys across tables.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

Writing JOINs to connect multiple tables.

Using GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for aggregation and filtering.

Applying aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN).

Designing queries for real-world business problems like revenue, stock management, and customer analysis.
